ShakePrompt is a tool to help memorize Shakespeare. Given a complete list of a character's lines and cues from [Open Source Shakespeare](http://opensourceshakespeare.org/), it will provide sequential or random cues, and let the user prompt themselves one word at a time or with the whole line.

Project is currently in very early stages of development and possibly buggy, but functional.

Requires the [Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6](http://java.com/en/) or higher.
